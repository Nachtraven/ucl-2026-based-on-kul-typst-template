= State of the art

Blurb:

methods for reconstruction of structures from imaging data
  in 2d
  in 3d
methods for microct analysis
  specifically, methods for 3d reconstruction
methods for vascularization reconstruction
  for different body parts
  for different purposes
  for different imaging modalities

== Overview

We will begin with generic semantic information extraction in 2D, expand to 3D
TODO: Clarify terminology reconstruction vs segmentation vs skeletonization/nodes and branches vs registration (?)
