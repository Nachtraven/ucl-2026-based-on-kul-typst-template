= State of the art

Blurb:

methods for reconstruction of structures from imaging data
  in 2d
  in 3d
methods for microct analysis
  specifically, methods for 3d reconstruction
methods for vascularization reconstruction
  for different body parts
  for different purposes
  for different imaging modalities

== Overview

We will begin with generic semantic information extraction in 2D, expand to 3D
TODO: Clarify terminology reconstruction vs segmentation vs skeletonization/nodes and branches vs registration (?)
then we will move on to MicroCT specific segmentation and reconstruction
and then move on to reconstruction of vascularization specifically

== Semantic information extraction

=== 2D

=== 3D

== MicroCT semantic information extraction

=== Pre-processing/filtering/area of interest

=== classical techniques (thresholding)
limitations

=== Machine learning techniques

=== Tools used in the real world (Avizo, Dragonfly)

== Vascularization reconstruction

Vascularization in different body parts and tissues -> explain it varies and if anyone has done a review

=== 2D
Echography
2D histo etc

=== 3D


= To be defined better:

== Portable machine learning / Opensource / Freely available software

Discuss limitations of current softwares wrt portability

=== Opensource
SOTA of Opensource methods

=== Closed source / Paid
SOTA of closed source methods
==== General histo
==== MicroCT/3D
