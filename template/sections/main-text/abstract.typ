Elevator pitch:
I am working on reconstructing the vascularization network of tumors imaged using microct, a method of ct or xray scanning that is of particularly high resolution. The raw images are generally not directly usable as the vascularization is discontinuous, and the way it appears in images varies based on the size of the vasculature, due to more contrast agent being present in larger vessels, and smaller vessels not getting any agent, but contrast in this case being due to the red blood cells.


== Abstract (1-2pp):

Soft tissue analysis presents multiple challenges relating to the required techniques to obtain structural information. One such technique is MicroCT, an Ex-vivo method of 3D reconstruction. However, this process, as with all imaging processes, does not produce semantic information in and of itself. The step of semantic extraction generally makes use of expert knowledge, computer algorithms, or more recently machine and deep learning. In this document, we aim to develop an adaptable and re-usable method for the semantic extraction of blood vessels from MicroCT scans, characterized by one practical application: that of extracting vascularization of tumors, in order to compare tumors treated with a vasculature modifying treatment with control tumors.
