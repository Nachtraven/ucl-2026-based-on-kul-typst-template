I. Introduction

The liver vessel segmentation is the basis of many clinical applications. For example, liver surgical planning requires accurate analysis on the structures of liver vessels and the locations of tumors related to these structures. Automatic and robust vasculature segmentation is, therefore, of great benefit in effective and efficient analysis and quantitative measure of these structures. Liver vessel segmentation in CT images is challenging due to noise. In addition, the vascular anatomy of the liver is complex [1]. There are four different tubular systems that supply and drain the liver: portal vein, hepatic vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct. Since the portal vein, the hepatic artery, and the bile ducts are parallel channels within portal tract, the portal vein and hepatic vein represent the main vessel structures inside the liver. However, the portal vein and hepatic veins show similar intensity value on CT images due to their similarity in the enhancement characteristics. They are curvy, twist, occlude one another and sometimes are seriously distorted by liver tumors. Therefore, it is difficult to segment and distinguish between them. In addition, low contrast and partial volume effect impose more difficulties upon the automatic liver vessel segmentation.
